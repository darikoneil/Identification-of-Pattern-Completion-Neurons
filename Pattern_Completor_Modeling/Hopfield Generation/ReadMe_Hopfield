# SIMULATIONS_FOR_CRF

## Run for simulation of CRFS in: 
#### Identification of Pattern Completion Neurons in Neuronal Ensembles using Probabilistic Graphical Models
#### Luis Carrillo-Reid, Neurobiology Institute UNAM
#### Shuting Han, Columbia University
#### Darik O'Neil, Columbia University
#### Ekaterina Taralova, Columbia University
#### Tony Jebara, Columbia University
#### Rafael Yuste, Columbia University

## Hopfield Nets were created as in the following citation and then merged
#### Wulfram Gerstner, Werner M. Kistler, Richard Naud, and Liam Paninski.
#### Neuronal Dynamics: From Single Neurons to Networks and Models of Cognition.
#### Cambridge University Press, 2014.

## Details
#### The python script attached produces Hopfield Networks as used in the publication, though two networks (large, and small) are provided for demoing the CRF code.
