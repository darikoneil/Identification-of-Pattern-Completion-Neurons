# Demo of CRF code used in:

#### Identification of Pattern Completion Neurons in Neuronal Ensembles using Probabilistic Graphical Models
#### Luis Carrillo-Reid, Neurobiology Institute UNAM
#### Shuting Han, Columbia University
#### Darik O'Neil, Columbia University
#### Ekaterina Taralova, Columbia University
#### Tony Jebara, Columbia University
#### Rafael Yuste, Columbia University

## Software Requirements
Linux only (Tested on Ubuntu & Matlab2019b)
Recompilation of associated thirdparty mex-files requires GCC/G++ version 6.3.X

## Installation
Open a terminal in the folder "Pattern_Completor_Modeling"
Enter bash UBUNTU_SETUP.sh in the terminal
Enter "1" for "Yes" to install

## Running the Demo
Open Matlab
Run the Run_Demo script
For ease of demoing, a small model option was included that is 1/10th the size of the network used in the publication.
