# SIMULATIONS_FOR_CRF

## Run for simulation of CRFS in: 
#### Identification of Pattern Completion Neurons in Neuronal Ensembles using Probabilistic Graphical Models
#### Luis Carrillo-Reid, Neurobiology Institute UNAM
#### Shuting Han, Columbia University
#### Darik O'Neil, Columbia University
#### Ekaterina Taralova, Columbia University
#### Tony Jebara, Columbia University
#### Rafael Yuste, Columbia University

## Hopfield Nets Subgraphs were created as in
#### Wulfram Gerstner, Werner M. Kistler, Richard Naud, and Liam Paninski.
#### Neuronal Dynamics: From Single Neurons to Networks and Models of Cognition.
#### Cambridge University Press, 2014.

## Details
#### The python script attached produces these subgraphs & the correct percentage of extra-subgraph activity to achieve biological plausibility
#### The matlab script merges the subgraphs into one graph and preps the data for import in the CRF model
